**Multiplayer WebVR worlds, procedurally generated with hotloaded `npm` modules.** üå±üå≥üåãüå≤üê¶üèÉüéÆ

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/x16vv3nrqm248rp0?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/modulesio/zeo)

:warning: _Alpha. Getting ready for [Steam](http://steampowered.com/) release. If you can't wait, [join us on Slack](zeovr.slack.com) or [add your email here](http://eepurl.com/cDEnID)._ :warning:

## Overview

Mods are plain [hotloaded](https://github.com/modulesio/archae/) Javascript. Frontend API is plain [THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/). Mods run on both frontend and backend, so they can do pretty much anything. Voxel-based world builder mods loaded by default.

Mouse + keyboard emulation; only requirement is a modern browser -- but it's more awesome with a headset.

Avatars and items persist across servers on a globally distributed blockchain. Buy, sell, trade, and _own_ your items, skins and plugins using worthless virtual credits.

Mod API supports the usual suspects: position tracking, controller events, multiplayer avatars tracking, configurator menu rendering, positional audio, asset loader, and more. Normalized to work the same regardless of headset (or lack thereof).

The server also handles firewall routing, module hotloading, and world storage, so you don't have to worry about that nonsense.

## Troubleshooting

#### General

Windows, OSX, and Linux are supported. `node 8+` is required, but included if you use Docker or the Windows builds.

This project uses native modules, so if you're using `node` you'll need build tools and [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) configured or else you'll get an error on `npm install`.

#### OSX

- Make sure you have [Xcode and `Command Line Tools`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-mac-os-x)
- Check that _node-gyp_ is in the `PATH`: `node-gyp`
- Check that _Command Line Tools_ are installed: `xcode-select --install`
- Check that _gcc_ is installed: `gcc`
- Point `xcode-select` to the developer directory: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
- Make sure that `~/.node-gyp/<version>/include/node/config.gypi` is correct (correct Xcode version, etc.)
