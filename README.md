**Multiplayer WebVR worlds, procedurally generated with hotloaded `npm` modules.**


üå±üå≥üåãüå≤üê¶üèÉüéÆ

:warning: _Alpha. Getting ready for [Steam](http://steampowered.com/) release. If you can't wait, [join us on Slack](zeovr.slack.com) or [add your email here](http://eepurl.com/cDEnID)._ :warning:

## Overview

Mods are plain [hotloaded](https://github.com/modulesio/archae/) Javascript. Frontend API is plain [THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/). Mods run on both frontend and backend, so they can do pretty much anything. Voxel-based world builder mods loaded by default.

Mouse + keyboard emulation; only requirement is a modern browser -- but it's more awesome with a headset.

Avatars and items persist across servers on a globally distributed blockchain. Buy, sell, trade, and _own_ your items, skins and plugins using worthless virtual credits.

Mod API supports the usual suspects: position tracking, controller events, multiplayer avatars tracking, configurator menu rendering, positional audio, asset loader, and more. Normalized to work the same regardless of headset (or lack thereof).

The server also handles firewall routing, module hotloading, and world storage, so you don't have to worry about that nonsense.

## Trouble shooting

#### On mac
Make sure that you have [Xcode and `Command Line Tools`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-mac-os-x) installed. Also, make sure that `node-gyp` is configured with both of those.

---

If you run into problems here are some steps that you can go through:
- Make sure that you are running with root (`sudo`)
-  Delete `node_modules` and re-install [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
- `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
- Make **sure** that Command Line Tools are installed `xcode-select --install`
- Make **sure** that gcc is installed
- Make sure that `~/.node-gyp/<version>/include/node/config.gypi` is correct (correct Xcode version, ect)
